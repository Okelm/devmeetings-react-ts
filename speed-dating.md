# Speed dating

1. Let's get to know who's on the workshops besides you and your laptop
2. That's how we do it:
   1. pick a random person, if you've come with somebody, they are not random people :\) 
   2. say hello,
   3. say something about yourself, try to limit it to like 90 seconds, and then let the other person take their turn,
   4. we will repeat it 10 times - watch for the signal from us
