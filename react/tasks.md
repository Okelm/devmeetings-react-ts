# Tasks

> **Hint**: CSS is not the topic here. The priority should be completing as many tasks as you can, even if it means your app looks like crap.

## 1. You'll only need `index.tsx`, `App.tsx`, and `react-app-env.d.ts` files. Remove all other files and unused code - including the component code form `App.tsx`.

## 2. Create the `Contact` type

## 3. Create a simple component that displays a user contact

> A contact should have name, phone number, e-mail address and address.
>
> **Hint**: you can use [randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me/) for user data - just copy it over to your code.
