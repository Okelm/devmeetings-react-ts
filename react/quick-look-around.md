# Quick look around

We are going to be looking at the `src` directory, but first:

## tsconfig.json

This file contains the config for the TypeScript compiler; here's couple of interesting lines to check out:

```javascript
"target": "es5"
```

Version of JavaScript standard to compile to. ES5 is fine for semi-modern browsers, ES6 can be used for controlled environments \(like node\).

```javascript
"strict": true
```

Enables 4 flags:

* `alwaysStrict` - enables JavaScript strict mode for every emitted file
* `strictNullChecks` - forces better checks for `null`/`undefined`
* `noImplicitAny` - forces typing for variables/arguments
* `noImplicitThis` - forces typing for `this`, [preventing](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/5040) [context](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33973648/react-this-is-undefined-inside-a-component-function) [sheningans](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47626045/typeerror-this-is-undefined-react-js-javascript)

:warning: Personal opinion: should be turned on for ALL new projects, but it's probably a good idea to turn this option to false for existing codebases.

## src/App.css

Styles for the `App` component.

## src/App.test.tsx

Unit tests for the component.

## src/App.tsx

Finally, the component file itself. There's some code written already that we'll replace.

* capital "A" - all component names \(and filenames\) should be written in upper camel case, without any pre- or suffixes. \( :warning: according to AirBnB style-guide \)
* `export default App;` - default exports are a standard practice for React.
* `return ( ...` - allows for better formatting

By the way, `.tsx` stands for TypeScript + JSX.

## src/index.tsx

Entry point of the whole operation, starts our React app with the `ReactDOM.render` line. This is where most of the global stuff, like global styles, should go.

## src/index.css

Global styles

## src/logo.svg

Not interesting in itself, but why here and not in `/public` directory? `/public` contains only truly static assets, while importing them into the component file allows for easier usage and webpack transformations.

## src/react-app-env.d.ts

Typings for the React environment internals. Not interesting from the app development standpoint, but removing it will break the project.

## src/serviceWorker.ts

Contains the code for a default service worker enabling PWA style app. Also, all files that don't contain components should be named using the lower camel-case style.
